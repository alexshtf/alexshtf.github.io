title: Eigenvalue models
status: in progress
---
Write about models build from

$$
f(\mathbf{x}) = \left\langle \mathbf{v}, \lambda\left(\mathbf{A}_0 + \sum_{k=1}^n x_k \mathbf{A}_k \right) \right\rangle,
$$

where $\lambda$ is a vector of eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix, and $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{A}_i$ are (potentially) learned from data.

- [x] Intro - a taste of eigenvalues
- [ ] Using attention mechanism as $$\mathbf{v}$$ to mix eigenvalues
- [ ] Smaller-dimension matrices (low rank / banded)
